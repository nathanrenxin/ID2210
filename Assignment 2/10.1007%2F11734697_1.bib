abstract="Overlay topology plays an important role in P2P systems. Topology serves as a basis for achieving functions such as routing, searching and information dissemination, and it has a major impact on their efficiency, cost and robustness. Furthermore, the solution to problems such as sorting and clustering of nodes can also be interpreted as a topology. In this paper we propose a generic protocol, T-MAN, for constructing and maintaining a large class of topologies. In the proposed framework, a topology is defined with the help of a ranking function. The nodes participating in the protocol can use this ranking function to order any set of other nodes according to preference for choosing them as a neighbor. This simple abstraction makes it possible to control the self-organization process of topologies in a straightforward, intuitive and flexible manner. At the same time, the T-MAN protocol involves only local communication to increase the quality of the current set of neighbors of each node. We show that this bottom-up approach results in fast convergence and high robustness in dynamic environments. The protocol can be applied as a standalone solution as well as a component for recovery or bootstrapping of other protocols.",
