abstract="This paper presents the design and implementation of the Dynamic Transport Library (DTL), a UDP-based reliable transport library, initially designed for - but not limited to - peer-to-peer applications. DTL combines many features not simultaneously offered by any other transport library including: i) Wide scope of congestion control levels starting from less-than-best-effort to high-priority, ii) Prioritization of traffic relative to other non-DTL traffic, iii) Prioritization of traffic between DTL connections, iv) NAT-friendliness, v) Portability, and vi) Application level implementation. Moreover, DTL has a novel feature, namely, the ability to change the level of aggressiveness of a certain connection at run-time. All the features of the DTL were validated using a controlled environment as well as the Planet Lab testbed.",
